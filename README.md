# Surface Temperature of the United States

This is a fun data-science project where I'll be creating a chloropeth map of
the US tracking surface temperature for each state in relevance to time.

The dataset that I've grabbed can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data#GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv). There are 5 `.csv` files and I'll only
be using the `GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv`.

## How to Guide

### Requirements
* Python 3

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Will follow soon after project is completed! :)
